# IEEEXtreme-14.0-Training-Workshop

IEEEXtreme is a global challenge in which teams of IEEE Student members – advised and proctored by an IEEE member, and often supported by an IEEE Student Branch – compete in a 24-hour time span against each other to solve a set of programming problems.

For that, the IEEE ENICarthage SB organized a series of workshops to prepare our students for this competition. I had the honor to make a presentation entitled as 'Introduction 
to Competitive Programming' as well as assuring one workshop where I walked the trainees into different techniques to be better at problem solving in general.

Check out the presentation and the notebooks if you are really interested.

I do problem solving in Codewars mainly: https://www.codewars.com/users/khaledadrani
